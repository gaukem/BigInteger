# BigInteger
Working with big integer by C++ standard.
Maybe have some library support working with big integer (512 bits, 1024 bits): GNU Multiple Precision Arithmetic Library, ... 
But by C++ standard, which I clone from repository: https://github.com/ron4fun/BigIntegerCPP
Then change some place to working with C++ standard. And implement sample: Elliptic Curve on Big Integer.
